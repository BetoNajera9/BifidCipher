# BifidCipher
The Bifid cipher was created in about 1901 by a French cryptographer, FÃ©lix Delastalle. Although it has never been used for military or any other "serious" purpose, it has a very elegant design, is easy to implement, and quite hard to break given its simplicity. The key for this cipher is any permutation of the alphabet (except for the letter J). One way to remember a key is to choose a word with no repeating letters such as "ENCRYPT" to start the permutation, and finish with the remaining letters. This permutation is placed in a 5 x 5 array called the tableau.
